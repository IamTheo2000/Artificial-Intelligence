# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains the theoretical and programming assignments for the course of AI-NTUA winter semester 2021-2022.

The three theoretical covered the following topics respectively:
* Searching algorithms
* Logic and machine learning
* Uncertainty and ambiguity

The three programming exercises contained:
* Application of algorithms for searching and finding the best path in a NxN maze
* Building a simple recommendation system for movies
* Implementation of several simple machine learning algorithms for the automatic recognition between 3 music genres from the data provided by Spotify.

## The material of the class was split in three sections
Section 1: Search algorithms, State Space Problem Description, Solution Search Algorithms, Blind Search Algorithms (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Iterative Deepening Search, Bidirectional Search), Heuristic Search Algorithms (Heuristic Mechanisms, Hill Climbing Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Forbidden Search Situations, Best First Search, Algorithm A*), Gaming Algorithms (Minimax Algorithm, AlphaBeta Algorithm)
Section 2: Artificial Intelligence and Logic, Propositional Logic (Syntax, Semantics, Interpretation, Satisfiability, Knowledge Models, Categorical and Implicit Knowledge, Logical Inference, Reasoning Algorithms, SAT solvers, Resolution), First-Order Logic (Management of Variables and Quantifiers, Analysis Algorithm for First-Order Logic, Decisibility), Logic Programming (Horn Logic, SLD Analysis, Facts and Rules, Search Strategies, Herbrand Basis, the PROLOG Language, Rejection as Failure, Production Systems, Expert Systems), Structured Knowledge Representations (Objects, Contexts, Semantic Networks, Knowledge Graphs, Descriptive Logics )
Section 3: Uncertainty and Machine Learning, Probabilistic Approaches (Probability Theory, Bayes Rule, Bayes Classifiers, Belief Networks, Plausibility, Dempster-Shafer Theory), Fuzzy Logic (Fuzzy Sets, Participation Functions, Fuzzy Partitions, Fuzzy Systems, Fuzzy Clustering), Adaptive Agents (Learning Problems, Terminology , Learning Scenarios, PAC learning), Learning Problems and Models (Linear Classification, Perceptrons, Optimal Hyperlayers, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Non-Linear Separability, Kernel Functions, Multi-Layer Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks), Each assignment is included in a separate folder, containing the necessary files and instructions for completion.
